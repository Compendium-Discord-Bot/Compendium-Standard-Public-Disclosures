# Cookie Policy

## How many cookies do we need?

Only two!

Yes, just 2 cookies, and nothing more. If there are more, we will notify you via the official Compendium Support Discord server, or in the /acknowledgements command in the Compendium bot.

## What are these two cookies used for?

1. Notification Dismissal Cookie
    When you see our cookie notification for the first time and decide to dismiss it, we save a cookie on your device. This cookie’s job is to remind Compendium that you’ve already seen and closed the notification, so we don’t keep bugging you every time you visit.

2. Session Cookie
    When you log in on our website, we use a session cookie to remember that you're still here. It helps us know who you are while you’re navigating between pages. It’s like a temporary name tag that disappears when you leave the site or close your browser.

## What about trackers, selling data, advertising, user privacy, etc. ?

We will never sell or share user (your) data with 3rd party, no matter what benefits we may be offered! This is one of our most foundational commitments to you.
We will share data only by legal obligation. Read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/Privacy-Policy.md).
