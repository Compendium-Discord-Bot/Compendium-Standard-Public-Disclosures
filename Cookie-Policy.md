# Cookie Policy

## How many cookies do we need?

Only two!

Yes, just 2 cookies, and nothing more.</br>
If there are more, we will notify you via the official accouncement channel in Compendium Support Discord server, as well as in the /cookies-used command in the Compendium bot.</br>
They will added here as well with description of what they are for.

## What are these two cookies used for?

1. Notification Dismissal Cookie
    
    When you see our cookie notification for the first time and decide to dismiss it, we save a cookie on your device.</br>
    This cookie’s job is to remind Compendium that you’ve already seen and closed the notification, so we don’t keep bugging you every time you visit.

2. Session Cookie
    
    When you log in on our website, we use a session cookie to remember that you're still here.</br>
    It helps us know who you are while you’re navigating between pages.</br>
    It’s like a temporary name tag that helps us identify you while you are going thru pages on our website.

## What about trackers, selling data, advertising, user privacy, etc. ?

We will never sell or share user (your) data with 3rd party, no matter what benefits we may be offered!</br>
This is one of our most foundational commitments to you.</br>
We will share data only by legal obligation.</br>
