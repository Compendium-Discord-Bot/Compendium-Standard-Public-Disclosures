# Cookie Policy

## How many cookies do we need?

Only 2!

Yes, just 2 cookies, and nothing more

## What are these 2 cookies used for?

1. Notification Dismissal Cookie
    When you see our cookie notification for the first time and decide to dismiss it, we save a cookie on your device. This cookie’s job is to just remember that you’ve already seen and closed the notification, so we don’t keep bugging you with it every time you visit.

2. Session Cookie
    When you log in on our website, we use a session cookie to remember that you're still here. It helps us know who you are while you’re navigating between pages. It’s like a temporary name tag that disappears when you leave the site or close your browser.

## What about trackers, selling data, advertising, user privacy, etc. ?

We will never sell or share user (your) data with 3rd party, no matter what benefits we may be offered!
This, is our stricktiest rule, and foundation of our principles
We will share data only if we are required to by law enforcement via court order or subpoena
which you may notice in our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/Privacy-Policy.md)
