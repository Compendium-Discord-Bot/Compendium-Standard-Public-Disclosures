## What do we use said data for:
- To provide the service of knowledge manageability within servers.
- We may use data from documents to train our internal AI in the future.
   - **When will we be adding AI features?**  
      All users that own or modified any document that is stored within our service will be notified 1 month before we start testing or training of any kind of AI.
   - **What data we would be using in the future to train/operate said AI:**  
      - Data from documents created by you.
   - **What would we use our internal AI for:**  
      - Service enrichment — providing additional features for end-users of our service.
      - Validate that documents stored by us are not used in a malicious way.
      - Verify if a document should be tagged as NSFW.
      - Verify if a document violates any [rules](https://discord.com/channels/1232458290563387392/1232458290601136150) and/or our [terms of service](https://discord.com/channels/1232458290563387392/1286979373391548437).

## Data Retention:
We retain data for as long as necessary to provide our services effectively. Specifically:
- **Document data**: Stored until the document owner requests deletion or no longer owns the server.
- **Infraction history**: Stored indefinitely for accountability and service integrity purposes.
- **Support request data**: Retained for 6 months after the resolution of the request, unless required longer for legal purposes.

## Your Data Rights:
Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your data:
- **Access**: You can request a copy of the data we store related to you.
- **Rectification**: If any data we have is inaccurate, you have the right to request corrections.
- **Deletion**: You can request deletion of your data (except infraction history).
- **Data Portability**: You can request a copy of your data in a machine-readable format.

To exercise any of these rights, please open a request via `<#ticket-channel>` or contact us at `[WIP Contact Email]`.

## Third-Party Services:
We use third-party services to help operate our platform (e.g., cloud storage, hosting). These services may process or store data on our behalf but are contractually bound to follow our data protection policies and cannot use your data for their own purposes.
- Hosting provider
- Discord

## Data Security:
We take data security seriously and implement the following measures to protect your information:
- Data is stored securely using encryption.
- Access to sensitive data is limited to authorized personnel only.
- Regular security audits and updates to maintain the integrity of our systems.  

However, no system is completely secure. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected users promptly.

## What kind of data we share or sell:
### We will NEVER sell or share your data to a 3rd party.
Please do not even attempt to approach us with any kind of proposition to sell user data; you would just be wasting your time, and ours.  
Instead of trying to approach us with the intention to share or sell user data, go back to the naughty corner and reflect on your actions.

Since we may be required to share some data by applicable law to comply with requests from law enforcement, such as subpoenas or court orders:
- **What do we share in case of court orders or subpoenas?**
   - Data from documents.
   - Timestamps and history of document editions.
   - User infraction history.

Any requests should be sent over to `[WIP]` from a government domain in a PDF file that has been digitally signed.  
Since we do not store users' legal names or other personal data, we will need the Discord user ID or the ID of the document your request is referring to, in order to provide the data from the request.

## Data Deletion:
If you wish, you can request us to delete all documents that are currently owned by you or by a Discord server that you own.  
To do so, go to `<#ticket-channel>` and select `data deletion request` from the select menu available there.

### What we will not be deleting:
- **User infraction history** — we require it to prove any misuse of our service or violation of rules.
- **Document edition history** — we require this data for legal and service operation purposes.

## AI Usage:
We may use data from documents created by you to train our internal AI for service improvement. Only documents explicitly made public or shared within servers will be considered for AI training.
- Users will be notified at least 1 month before any AI training begins.
- Users who wish to exclude their documents from AI training can opt out by submitting a request via `<#ticket-channel>`.

## Contact Us:
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or wish to exercise any of your data rights, please contact us at `[WIP Contact Email]` or through our support channels.

# NOTE:
Why is the above written in plain English with some points instead of legal gibberish?
1. None of us, the people who started this project, have been educated in legalese or other various law shenanigans.
- We believe that a privacy policy shouldn't be something that is used to justify stealing and/or selling user data in any way, shape, or form.
- We wanted to be clear about what we are doing with your data, and what happens with it.
