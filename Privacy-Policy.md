    - Validate that documents stored by us are not used in a malicious way.
    - Verify if a document should be tagged as NSFW.
    - Verify if a document violates any [rules](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/Rules.md) and/or our [terms of service](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/Terms-of-Service.md).

## Data Retention:

We retain data for as long as necessary to provide our services effectively. Specifically:

- **Document data**: Stored until the document owner requests deletion or no longer owns the server.
- **Infraction history**: Stored indefinitely for accountability and service integrity purposes.
- **Support request data**: Retained for 6 months after the resolution of the request, unless required for longer to serve legal obligations.

## Your Data Rights:

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your data, with some limitations:

- **Access**: You may request a copy of the data we store related to you.
- **Rectification**: If any data we have is inaccurate, you have the right to request corrections.
- **Deletion**: You can request deletion of your data, with the exception of infraction history.
- **Data Portability**: You can request a copy of your data in a machine-readable format.

To exercise any of these rights, please open a request via `<#ticket-channel>` or contact us at `[WIP Contact Email]`.

### Limitations

#### Infraction Data

1. Infraction data is classified as priviliged and confidential.
2. Infraction data is retained indefinitely, and will not be deleted except in compliance to applicable laws.

## Third-Party Services:

We use third-party services to help operate our platform (e.g., cloud storage, hosting). These services may process or store data on our behalf but are contractually bound to follow our data protection policies and cannot use your data for their own purposes.

- Data, network and computing hosting providers
- Discord

## Data Security:

We take data security seriously and implement the following measures to protect your information:

- Data is stored securely using encryption.
- Access to sensitive data is limited to authorized personnel only.
- Regular security audits and updates to maintain the integrity of our systems.

However, no system is completely secure. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected users promptly.

## What kind of data we share or sell:

### We will NEVER sell or share your data to a third party.

Please do not even attempt to approach us with any kind of proposition to sell user data; you would just be wasting your time, and ours.
Instead of trying to approach us with the intention to share or sell user data, go back to the naughty corner and reflect on your actions.

Since we may be required to share some data by applicable law to comply with requests from law enforcement, such as subpoenas or court orders:

- **What do we share in case of court orders or subpoenas?**
  - Data from documents.
  - Timestamps and history of document editions.
  - User infraction history.
  - Any other information or data stored in reference to the named parties on the request(s).

Any requests should be sent over to `[WIP]` from a government domain in a PDF file that has been digitally signed. Since we do not store users' legal names or other personal data, in order to comply with the request, we will need:

* The Discord user ID, *OR*
* The ID or IDs of the documents your request concerns.

## Data Deletion:

If you wish, you can request us to delete all documents that are currently owned by you or by a Discord server that you own.
To do so, go to `<#ticket-channel>` and select `Data Deletion` from the select menu available there.

### What we will not be deleting:

- **User infraction history** — We require it to record any misuse of our service or violation of rules.
- **Document edition history** — We require this data to enable operation of our services and for legal purposes.

## AI Usage:

We may use data from documents created by you to train our internal AI for service improvement. Only documents explicitly made public or shared within servers will be considered for AI training.

- Users will be notified at least 30 calendar days before testing or training of any AI model begins.
- Users who wish to exclude their documents or servers from AI training can opt out by submitting a request via `<#ticket-channel>`.

## Contact Us:

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or wish to exercise any of your data rights, please contact us at `[WIP Contact Email]` or through our support channels.

# Commitments:

* We believe that a privacy policy shouldn't be something that is used to justify stealing and/or selling user data in any way, shape, or form.

- We believe that clarity and trust are important and necessary, and that you deserve to know what happens with the data you entrust to us.
