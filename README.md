# Legal Stuff We Are Required To Share

## Why is this repo seemingly unfinished?

None of us are trained to interpret laws or craft legal documents, so while we hope to create a finely-crafted bot for your experience on Discord, we are not all-skillful, and will leave those things for a different person, for a different time, for when the bot takes a more defined shape.

### Why didn't we hire someone who is well versed in legal stuff to make those files for us?

We will, in due time.

So why write anything at all now? We wanted our intents to be perfectly understandable to everyone in the mean time. As Compendium takes shape, these may be subject to change. For now, take what you see here as a guide to how things will look in the future.

## When will the bot be available in *my* language?

Well, at first we want to make the bot work perfectly fine with everything being clear in English, the most popular language. Further localization is a goal, admittedly a more distant one. If you are fluent in another language and understand English well, consider offering a hand when the time comes!
