# Legal Stuff We Are Required To Share

## Why this repo looks the way it looks, and why there is no legalease BS smeared all over it?
Yeah, so
Since the laws and such exist, here are some documents that are writen in a human language (plain English), we tried to limit the use legalese terms to as few as possible, due to them often being horribly misleading for plain mortals (including us).

None of us is an expert in terms of legal stuff across different countries, We are just a bunch of devs that decided to make bot with features that we did not see to be publicly available on discord.

## A little bit of FAQ

### Why didn't we hire someone who is well versed in legal stuff to make those files for us?
Well, if we did, they would tell us that writing stuff in human is a bad idea and would force us to use legalese to make a strawberry mush out of readers brain
And we wanted these to be perfectly understandable to everyone.

Not to mention, we did not make this project to make a profit off it, but to offer cool features and expand our knowledge and skill sets when tackilng problems or needing to figure out best way to handle something.

### When will the bot be available in ... language?
Well, at first we want to make the bot work perfectly fine with everything being clear in English, the most popular language.
When we are ready, we will provide a few json files in a separate repository

Since we are not exactly capable of learning every single natural language that exists, for translation verification we will be utilizing machine language translations, just to verify that there is nothing explicit or inapropriet happening in those trasnlated strings...
