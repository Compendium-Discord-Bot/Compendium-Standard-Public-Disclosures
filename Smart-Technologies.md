# Smart Technologies

The Smart Technologies policy governs any and all usage of algorithms, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more, that are not primary technologies provided in Compendium's core product offering.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Models Used

* We are currently not using any AI models as any part of Compendium. All users that own or modified any document that is stored within our service will be notified 30 calendar days before we begin any testing or training of AI models.
* Any AI model used by Compendium will ideally not be an external service, since most services, if not all, would require us to grant them a license to do whatever they like with the provided data. We will never agree to this, as user data is held in trust with Compendium, and therefore we will not sublicense it to anyone.
* Upon the announcement of AI features, usage of all documents' content as training material for any AI will be disabled by default, and the user will be given the option to opt in.

### What data will be used to train/operate any AI?

- Data from documents created by you
- Files attached to documents, like images, or text files.

### What will the AI be used for?

- Service enrichmentâ€”providing additional features for end-users of our service.
- Validate that documents stored by us are not used in a malicious way.
- Verify if a document should be tagged as NSFW.
- Verify if a document violates any [rules](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/Rules.md) and/or our [terms of service](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/Terms-of-Service.md).
