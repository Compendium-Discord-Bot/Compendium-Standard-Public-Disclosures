# Terms of Service

Welcome!
By using our Discord-based service and interacting with our bot, you agree to follow these terms. We aim to keep things clear and straightforward, but if you have any questions, feel free to reach out via our support channels.

## 1. What We Do
We provide a service that helps you manage and organize information on Discord. This might include storing documents, tracking changes, and offering bot-driven features that enhance your Discord server experience.

## 2. Your Responsibilities
While using our service, you're expected to follow a few simple rules:
- **Follow Discord's Terms of Service**: By using our bot, you’re still bound by [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
- **Respect Others**: Don't harass, abuse, or act maliciously towards other users. Keep things civil and respectful.
- **Don’t Misuse the Service**: You must not use our service for illegal or harmful activities, such as posting NSFW content in non-NSFW channels, spamming, or distributing harmful content (e.g., viruses, malware).

## 3. Your Data
When using our service, some data is stored to ensure everything runs smoothly. For more detailed info, check out our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Leagal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md).

### Here’s a quick summary of what we store:
- Your Discord ID
- Documents created or modified by you
- Timestamps of your actions (like document edits)
- Your infraction history (if you break the rules)

We use this data to provide the service, improve it, and maintain community safety. We don’t sell or share your data with anyone, and you can request to delete your documents at any time.

## 4. Bot Usage and Commands
Our bot has specific commands and features. By using these commands, you agree:
- **Command Limits**: Some commands may have usage limits to prevent abuse or server strain. Please respect those limits.
- **Feature Changes**: We may add, modify, or remove features from time to time. We’ll do our best to notify you in advance of major changes, especially when it might affect your stored data.

## 5. AI Features (Future Use)
If we introduce AI features in the future (like document analysis or smart tools), you’ll be notified ahead of time. You’ll have the chance to opt-out if you don’t want your documents used for AI purposes. Full details are in the Privacy Policy.

## 6. Enforcement and Infractions
We strive to keep this service safe for everyone. If you break the rules, we might take action, including:
- **Warnings**: If your behavior violates these terms or our rules, we may issue a warning.
- **Temporary Suspension**: If violations continue, or are sever enough, we may temporarily block your access to the bot’s features.
- **Permanent Ban**: In severe cases (e.g., malicious use, harassment), you could be permanently banned from using the service.

Infractions are logged, and repeated offenses will lead to stricter penalties.

## 7. Updates to These Terms
We may update these terms from time to time. If there are any major changes, we’ll notify you through our Discord server or via the bot. You can always check the latest version in our public repository on GitHub.

## 8. Liability
We work hard to make sure everything runs smoothly, but:
- **No Guarantees**: We can’t promise that the service will be 100% error-free or available all the time. Things break, the internet goes down, and that’s life.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: You use this service at your own risk. We’re not responsible for any damages or losses caused by using our service or bot (e.g., lost data or server issues).

## 9. Contact Us
If you have any questions, issues, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out via our support channels on Discord.
