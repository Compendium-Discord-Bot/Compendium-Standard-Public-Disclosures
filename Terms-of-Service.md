# Terms of Service

Welcome!

By using our Discord-based service and interacting with our bot, you agree to follow these terms. We aim to keep things clear and straightforward, but if you have any questions, feel free to reach out via our support channels.

## 1. What We Do

We provide a service that helps you manage and organize information written by you on Discord. This might include storing documents, tracking changes, and offering bot-driven features that enhance your Discord server experience.

## 2. Your Responsibilities

While using our service, you're expected to follow a few simple rules:

- **Follow Discord's Terms of Service**: By using our bot, you are still bound by Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
- **Respect Others**: Do not use the service to harass, abuse, stalk, track, or otherwise act maliciously towards other users.
- **Don't Misuse the Service**: You must not use our service for illegal or harmful activities, such as posting NSFW content in non-NSFW channels, spamming, distributing harmful content (e.g., viruses, malware), or distributing content which violates property or copyright laws, or contributes to the knowledge of distribution of any illegal activities.

## 3. Your Data

When using our service, some data is stored to ensure everything runs smoothly. Below is a brief summary of what we store, however, for more details, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Compendium-Discord-Bot/Legal-Stuff-We-Are-Required-To-Share/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md).

- Your Discord ID
- Data from documents created or modified by you
- Timestamps of your actions (such as document edits)
- Your infraction history (if you break the rules)
- Data provided during support requests
- Translation data provided by those who applied to provide it

We use this data to provide the service, improve it, and maintain community safety.

## 4. Bot Usage and Commands

Our bot has specific commands and features. By using these commands, you agree:

- **Command Limits**: Some commands may have usage limits to prevent abuse or server strain. Efforts to intentionally or maliciously bypass these limitations will be punishable by suspension or termination of your account with Compendium.
- **Feature Changes**: We may add, modify, or remove features from time to time. We will give reasonable notification in advance of major changes, especially when it might affect your stored data.

## 5. AI Features (Future Use)

If we introduce AI features in the future (like document analysis or smart tools), you will be notified ahead of time. You will have the chance to opt out if you don't want your documents used for AI purposes. Full details are in the Privacy Policy.

## 6. Enforcement and Infractions

We strive to keep this service safe for everyone. If you break the rules, we may take any one or combination of actions, including:

- **Warnings**: If your behavior violates these terms or our rules, a warning may be issued.
- **Deletion or Revocation of Content**: If your contributions to content include violations of any private person's right to reasonable privacy, distribution of illegal or malicious content, or otherwise distributes copyrighted, confidential or classified materials, your content may be deleted or revoked from public view.
- **Temporary Suspension**: If violations continue, or are severe enough, we may temporarily block your access to the bot's features.
- **Permanent Ban**: In severe cases (e.g., malicious or illegal use, harassment), you may be permanently banned from using the service.

Infractions are logged, and repeated offenses will lead to stricter penalties.

## 7. Updates to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. Notification of significant changes will be delivered through our public Support Discord server or via the bot. You can always check the latest version in our public repository on GitHub.

## 8. Liability

We work hard to make sure everything runs smoothly, but:

- **Compendium is offered "AS-IS"**: Due to the nature of technology being finnicky, we cannot promise that the service will be completely free from errors, or interruptions to services and features.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: You use this service at your own risk. We are not responsible or liable for any damages or losses caused by using our service or bot (e.g., lost data or server issues).

## 9. Contact Us

If you have any questions, issues, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out via our support channels on Discord.
